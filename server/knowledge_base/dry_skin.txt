Title: Caring for Dry Skin

Characteristics:
Dry skin produces less sebum than normal skin, resulting in a lack of lipids needed to retain moisture and build a protective barrier. It often feels tight, rough, and may appear dull or flaky. Fine lines can be more visible. In severe cases, it can become itchy, red, and irritated.

Recommended Skincare Routine:
- Morning:
  1. Cleanser: Use a very gentle, hydrating, cream-based or milky cleanser. Avoid foaming cleansers. Some people with very dry skin may choose to just rinse with water in the morning.
  2. Toner/Essence: Apply a hydrating, alcohol-free toner or essence containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin.
  3. Serum: A hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid is highly recommended.
  4. Moisturizer: Use a rich, cream-based moisturizer with ceramides, shea butter, or fatty acids.
  5. Sunscreen: A moisturizing, dewy-finish sunscreen is best.

- Evening:
  1. Cleanser: Use the same gentle, creamy cleanser.
  2. Serum: Apply a hydrating or repairing serum.
  3. Moisturizer: Apply a generous layer of your rich moisturizer. You can even layer a facial oil on top for extra nourishment.

Key Ingredients to Look For:
- Hyaluronic Acid: A humectant that draws moisture into the skin.
- Ceramides: Lipids that help form the skin's barrier and retain moisture.
- Glycerin: Another humectant that attracts water to the skin.
- Shea Butter: A rich emollient that soothes and moisturizes.
- Lactic Acid (AHA): A gentle exfoliant that can help remove flaky skin and improve hydration.

What to Avoid:
- Hot water, which can strip the skin of its natural oils.
- Foaming cleansers with sulfates.
- Products containing high amounts of alcohol.
- Over-exfoliating with harsh physical scrubs.
