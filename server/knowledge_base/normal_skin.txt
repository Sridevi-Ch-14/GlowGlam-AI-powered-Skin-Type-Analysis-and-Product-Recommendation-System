Title: Maintaining Normal Skin

Characteristics:
Normal skin is well-balanced, meaning it is neither too oily nor too dry. It has fine pores, a smooth texture, and no severe sensitivity or frequent blemishes. The scientific term is 'eudermic'. The goal for this skin type is maintenance and prevention.

Recommended Skincare Routine:
- Morning:
  1. Cleanser: A gentle, non-stripping cleanser (gel or cream) is sufficient.
  2. Serum: An antioxidant serum, such as one with Vitamin C, is excellent for protection against environmental damage.
  3. Moisturizer: A light to medium-weight lotion is usually perfect.
  4. Sunscreen: Daily broad-spectrum sunscreen is the most important step to prevent aging and maintain skin health.

- Evening:
  1. Cleanser: Cleanse to remove makeup, sunscreen, and impurities from the day.
  2. Treatment (Optional): You can introduce a gentle active ingredient like a low-strength retinol a few times a week for anti-aging benefits, or a gentle AHA for exfoliation.
  3. Moisturizer: Apply your regular moisturizer.

Key Ingredients for Maintenance:
- Antioxidants (Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Niacinamide): Protect the skin from free radicals.
- Hyaluronic Acid: Provides lightweight hydration.
- Gentle Retinoids (Retinol): For long-term anti-aging and skin smoothing.
- Sunscreen (SPF): The number one ingredient for preventing skin damage and aging.

What to Avoid:
- While normal skin is resilient, avoid using overly harsh or aggressive products that could disrupt its natural balance.
- Don't skip on the basics like cleansing, moisturizing, and especially sunscreen.
