Title: Guide for Acne-Prone Skin

Characteristics:
Acne-prone skin is susceptible to comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory acne (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). It can be oily, but it can also be dry or combination. The primary causes are excess oil production, clogged pores, bacteria (P. acnes), and inflammation.

Recommended Skincare Routine:
- Morning:
  1. Cleanser: A gentle cleanser with a low percentage of salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.
  2. Moisturizer: A lightweight, oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer is crucial. Do not skip this step, as drying out the skin can worsen acne.
  3. Sunscreen: A non-comedogenic, oil-free sunscreen is mandatory, especially if using acne treatments that increase sun sensitivity.

- Evening:
  1. Cleanser: Thoroughly cleanse the skin.
  2. Treatment: This is the most important step. Apply a targeted acne treatment. This could be a product with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, a retinoid (like adapalene/Differin), or a prescription from a dermatologist. Start slowly to avoid irritation.
  3. Moisturizer: Apply moisturizer after your treatment has absorbed.

Key Ingredients to Look For:
- Benzoyl Peroxide: Kills acne-causing bacteria effectively. Available in different strengths (2.5%, 5%, 10%). Start low.
- Salicylic Acid (BHA): Unclogs pores from the inside. Excellent for blackheads and whiteheads.
- Retinoids (Adapalene, Retinol, Tretinoin): The gold standard for treating acne. They normalize skin cell turnover, preventing clogged pores.
- Niacinamide: Reduces inflammation and redness associated with breakouts.
- Azelaic Acid: Has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, good for treating acne and post-acne marks.

Important Tips:
- Do not pick or pop pimples, as this can lead to scarring and more inflammation.
- Be patient. Acne treatments can take 4-8 weeks to show results.
- Introduce new active ingredients one at a time to see how your skin reacts.
- Always moisturize. Many acne treatments can be drying.
