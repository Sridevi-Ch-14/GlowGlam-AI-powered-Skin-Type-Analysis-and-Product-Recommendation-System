Title: Managing Oily Skin

Characteristics:
Oily skin is characterized by excess sebum production from the sebaceous glands, leading to a persistently shiny or greasy appearance. Common traits include enlarged, visible pores, blackheads, and a tendency for breakouts and acne. Makeup may not last long on this skin type. The T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is often the most affected area.

Recommended Skincare Routine:
- Morning: 
  1. Cleanser: Use a gentle, foaming cleanser with ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to remove excess oil and unclog pores.
  2. Toner: An alcohol-free toner with niacinamide can help regulate oil production and minimize the appearance of pores.
  3. Serum (Optional): A lightweight, water-based serum can be used.
  4. Moisturizer: Use a lightweight, oil-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer. Gel-based formulas are excellent.
  5. Sunscreen: A non-greasy, matte-finish sunscreen is essential to protect the skin without adding shine.

- Evening:
  1. Cleanser: Double cleanse if you wear makeup, starting with an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based one.
  2. Treatment: Apply a treatment product containing salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or a retinoid to manage breakouts and oil.
  3. Moisturizer: Use the same lightweight moisturizer as in the morning.

Key Ingredients to Look For:
- Salicylic Acid (BHA): Exfoliates inside the pores, removing oil and dead skin cells.
- Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Helps regulate oil production, improves skin texture, and reduces inflammation.
- Benzoyl Peroxide: Kills acne-causing bacteria.
- Clay (Kaolin or Bentonite): Used in masks to absorb excess oil.
- Retinoids (Retinol, Tretinoin): Increase skin cell turnover, helping to unclog pores and reduce oil.

What to Avoid:
- Harsh, alcohol-based toners and scrubs that can strip the skin, causing it to produce even more oil in response.
- Heavy, occlusive moisturizers that can clog pores.
